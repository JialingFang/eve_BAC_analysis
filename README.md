# The code serves three primary functions:

1. **Calculate A-P Profile and Identify Stripes**:
   Computes the anterior-posterior (A-P) intensity profile of a fruit fly embryo by averaging pixel intensities column-wise within a specified embryo binary mask.

3. **Compare Whole Embryo Profiles by Alignment**:
    Aligns the entire A-P profiles of the target and control embryos onto a common X-axis.
    Ensures differences in overall stripe intensity patterns can be compared across embryos by normalization. 

4. **Compare Stripes by Regional Alignment**:
    Detects stripe boundaries using peak detection and dynamically determines start and end indices to isolate the relevant regions of interest.
    Focuses on specific stripe regions by aligning peak positions from the target and control embryos.
